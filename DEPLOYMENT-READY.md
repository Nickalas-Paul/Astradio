## 🔧 **What Was Fixed**

- ✅ **After**: Standalone API with no workspace dependencies

### **Changes Made**
1. **Removed all `file:` dependencies** from `package.json`
2. **Created local type definitions** in `apps/api/src/types/`
3. **Added core functionality** directly in `apps/api/src/core/`
4. **Fixed TypeScript compilation** with proper window declarations
5. **Updated Railway configuration** with correct start command
6. **Added all required environment variables**
