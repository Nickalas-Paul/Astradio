    - Opposition (180° ± 8°)
    - Trine (120° ± 8°)
    - Square (90° ± 8°)
    - Sextile (60° ± 6°)
  - Live aspect lines displayed on chart with color coding:
    - Conjunction: Yellow (#fbbf24)
    - Opposition: Red (#ef4444) with dashed lines
    - Trine: Green (#10b981)
    - Square: Orange (#f59e0b)
    - Sextile: Blue (#3b82f6)
  - Automatic detection when 2+ planets are placed
  - Configurable orb of influence
  - Real-time updates as planets are moved or removed

### 3. 📖 **Real-Time Interpretation Display**
- **Status**: ✅ FULLY IMPLEMENTED
- **Location**: `apps/web/src/components/SandboxComposer.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Dynamic aspect interpretation sidebar
  - Shows aspect type, planets involved, and interpretive meaning
  - Musical influence descriptions for each aspect type:
    - Conjunction: "Creates harmonic unity and melodic fusion"
    - Opposition: "Generates dynamic tension and call-and-response patterns"
    - Trine: "Creates smooth, flowing melodic progressions"
    - Square: "Produces rhythmic tension and dramatic harmonic progressions"
    - Sextile: "Facilitates melodic cooperation and complementary structures"
  - Orb measurements displayed with precision
  - Real-time updates as aspects are formed/broken
  - Scrollable interface for multiple aspects

### 4. 🎼 **Custom Music Playback from Sandbox**
- **Status**: ✅ FULLY IMPLEMENTED
- **Backend**: `apps/api/src/app.ts` - New `POST /api/audio/sandbox` endpoint
- **Audio Engine**: `packages/audio-mappings/src/audioGenerator.ts` - New `generateSandboxAudio()` method
- **Features**:
  - Generates music based ONLY on user's sandbox configuration
  - Incorporates house placement, aspects, and planet types
  - Genre-specific instrument mappings for all planets
  - Aspect-based harmonic notes with frequency ratios
  - Configuration overrides (tempo, volume, reverb, delay)
  - Supports all major planets and asteroids
  - Real-time audio generation and streaming

### 5. 📱 **House Selection Button (Mobile Support)**
- **Status**: ✅ FULLY IMPLEMENTED

- **Features**:
  - Dropdown for manual house selection
  - Shows current sign for each house based on wheel rotation
  - Mobile-friendly interface
  - Non-touchscreen support for planet placement
  - Dynamic updates as wheel rotates

## 🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### Frontend Components
- **Enhanced SandboxComposer**: Complete rewrite with aspect detection, drag-and-drop, and interpretation display
- **Updated Sandbox Page**: Integrated aspect handling and audio generation
- **Type Definitions**: Added `AspectData` interface to both web and shared types

### Backend Services
- **New API Endpoint**: `POST /api/audio/sandbox` for custom chart audio generation
- **Enhanced Audio Generator**: Added `generateSandboxAudio()` method with aspect-based harmonics
- **Aspect Processing**: Real-time aspect calculation and harmonic note generation

### Key Algorithms
- **Aspect Detection**: Angular distance calculation with configurable orbs
- **Harmonic Generation**: Frequency ratios based on aspect types
- **Planet Mapping**: Genre-specific instrument assignments
- **Audio Synthesis**: Real-time WAV buffer generation

## 🎯 TESTING CRITERIA MET
